# Registration Grants

We secured funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Google to offer grants to some participants to cover registration fees. The funds from the NSF are restricted to students currently enrolled at a US university; for the remaining funds, we will prioritize students, participants with accepted papers, and participants from universities outside of the US. 

The submission form on SoftConf contains information on how to apply for a registration grant.
