# Travel and Registration Grants

We secured funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Google to offer grants to some participants to partially cover travel and/or registration fees. The funds from the NSF are restricted to students currently enrolled at a US university; for the remaining funds, we will prioritize students, participants with accepted papers, and participants from universities outside of the US. 

We will announce soon how to apply for a grant.
