# Universal Dependencies Workshop 2020 (UDW 2020)

### [Coling 2020](https://coling2020.org), Barcelona, December 13, 2020 (new date!)


[Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/) (UD) is a
framework for cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation that
has so far been applied to over 80 languages.

The framework is aiming to capture similarities as well as
idiosyncracies among typologically different languages (e.g.,
morphologically rich languages, pro-drop languages, and languages
featuring clitic doubling). The goal in developing UD was not only to
support comparative evaluation and cross-lingual learning but also to
facilitate multilingual natural language processing and enable
comparative linguistic studies.

**Invited speaker**: Martha Palmer, University of Colorado Boulder, USA

**Note regarding the COVID-19 pandemic**: COLING 2020 and all associated workshops 
have now been postponed to December 2020 (read full statement [here](https://coling2020.org/2020/03/30/covid-19.html)). 
We hope that international travel will be possible for all participants 
at that point but we will provide opportunities for remote presentations 
to presenters who cannot attend in person due to potentially remaining travel bans.
