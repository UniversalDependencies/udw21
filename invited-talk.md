# Invited Talk: Martha Palmer, University of Colorado Boulder

## Transcending Dependencies

This talk will discuss some of the challenges arising from the Blocks World scenario in the DARPA Communicating with Computers program.  The actions are very simple and concrete, such as “Add a block to the tower.”  However, even in this restricted world, getting the appropriate contextual interpretation of a sentence can be challenging, especially with respect to spatial relations and implicit information.  The talk will review the progress we have made so far on collecting useful data that comprises complete 2 person dialogues discussing block structure constructions,  and our attempts to  achieve the goal of contextual interpretation in the processing of these dialogues.  A main focus will be the ways in which we are expanding AMR annotation to encompass spatial relations and the recovery of implicit arguments.  Both expansions play into the task of maintaining a discourse structure and producing the predicate logic sentence representations needed by the down-stream planner.  The talk will conclude with our current AMR parsing results, our attempts to pass them along to the planner, and our future goals.
