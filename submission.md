## Electronic Submission Information

We will be accepting submissions online via the conference management system: exact link TBA. The submission deadline for both long and short papers is May 15, 2020 (midnight PDT).

## IMPORTANT: New submission guidelines

UDW-20 adopts ACL’s [new policies for submission, review, and citation](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation). Submissions that violate any of these policies will be rejected without review. Most importantly, the policies refer to the anonymity period, which starts on April 15, 2020 for UDW-20.

You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period.

You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.

The details are described in the [ACL 2020 Author Guidelines](https://acl2020.org/calls/papers/#important-anonymity-period),  which we follow.


## Regular workshop papers

Regular workshop papers should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop, and can be included in the workshop proceedings published in the ACL anthology. Papers should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.

### Format

The maximum length is eight (8) pages of content for long papers and four (4) pages of content for short papers, plus up to two (2) pages of references.

Both long and short papers must follow the Coling 2020 format, using the [Coling style files](https://coling2020.org/coling2020.zip). Please do not modify these style files, or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs (udw-organisers@googlegroups.com). Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.

### Double-Blind Review Instructions
As the reviewing will be blind, submissions and supplementary materials must not include the authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”, should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith (1991) previously showed …”. Acknowledgments of funding or assistance must also be omitted. Submissions should not contain pointers to supplemental information on the web; any such material should be submitted as supplementary materials (see above). Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author identification information is required as part of the online submission process.

### Final submission (camera-ready versions of accepted papers)
The camera-ready versions must use the Coling style files provided, and when converting to PDF, make sure that the fonts are embedded. We allow one additional page to address reviewers’ comments. Thus long paper submissions cannot exceed nine (9) pages of content. Short paper submissions cannot exceed five (5) pages. References do not count against these limits.

### Presentation Requirement
All accepted papers must be presented at the conference in order to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for UDW-18. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the program chairs based on the nature rather than the quality of the work). There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally or as posters.

## Cross-submissions
In addition to unpublished work, in the spirit of promoting discussion about UD, we also solicit papers on related topics that have already appeared elsewhere. Interested authors need to submit their papers in PDF format through the same Softconf conference management system, with a note on the original venue. Papers in this category do not need to follow the Coling 2020 format and the selection is solely determined by the organizing committee. These papers will not be published in the UDW-20 proceedings.
